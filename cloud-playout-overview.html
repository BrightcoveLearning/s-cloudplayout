    <p>Brightcove Cloud Playout is a Studio module that enables you to program a scheduled playout of items from your VOD catalogue, combined with live feeds, and stream it as a Linear Channel all with the reliability and scalability of Brightcove Live.</p>
		<p>You can then use the Cloud Playout channel as a {{ site.product_short }} Channel by entering information about it in creating a <a href="/channels/{{ site.product_short }}-channels/creating-a-channel.html">{{ site.product_short }} Channel</a>. One major advantage to using Cloud Playout channels is that you will not need to find and integrate a 3rd party EPG provider, since an EPG service is built into Cloud Playout.</p>
    <p>Cloud Playout offers a powerful, end-to-end solution for channels of scheduled programming, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>24x7 Linear Channels</li>
      <li>Pop-Up / Virtual Channels</li>
      <li>Simulated Live Events</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cloud Playout helps you increase audience engagement and create new revenue opportunities through a broadcast-like, Live TV experience leveraging pre-recorded content. Use existing VOD assets and add live events (optionally) to create scheduled live channels.</p>

		<h2 id="workflow_overview">Workflow overview</h2>
		<p>There are four parts to creating a Cloud Playout channel and adding it to your {{ site.product_short }} app:</p>
		<ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
			<li>In <strong>{{ site.product_short }} Studio</strong>, create the channel.</li>
			<li>In <strong>{{ site.product_short }} Classic</strong>, create a new {{ site.product_short }} channel that uses the Cloud Playout channel as its source.</li>
      <li>In <strong>{{ site.product_short }} Studio</strong>, add the channel to a playlist.</li>
      <li>In <strong>{{ site.product_short }} Studio</strong>, add the playlist to page.</li>
		</ol>

    <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
    <p>The following assumptions and limitations apply.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your videos must be ingested or re-transcoded using a Dynamic Delivery profile and <strong>must have an MP4 rendition</strong>:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/s-cloudplayout-img/mp4-in-ingest-profile.png" alt="Ingest Profiles with MP4">
          <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Ingest Profiles with MP4</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>For channels to work in {{ site.product_short }}, you need to <strong>specify Brightcove Live as the destination</strong>.</li>
      <li>The maximum input bitrate and resolution supported for Cloud Playout is 20MBPS/1080p for VOD and live inputs.</li>
      <li>Brightcove recommends using videos with at least a 2 minute duration to ensure a correct transition between videos and electronic program guide accuracy</li>
      <li>Captions (text tracks) added to videos currently will not display in Cloud Playout channels. Support for captions will be added in a future release.</li>
      <li>The minimum length for Live events is 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Every Live Event in Cloud Playout shares an 1:1 relation with a Video Cloud remote asset. This remote asset cannot be re-used in other channels. If the live event is removed from the channel, the associated remote asset will be automatically deleted. When a channel is deleted, any associated remote assets will also be deleted automatically.</li>
      <li>Videos <strong>shared</strong> to the account from another account currently cannot be added to a Cloud Playout channel.</li>
      <li>When a live event is currently playing, but no active feed is available, the slate content will be played in a loop until the live feed resumes or the event ends. There will be a delay of approximately 30 seconds before the slate MP4 starts playing.</li>
      <!--<li><strong>Input Looper : if the asset URL is duplicated, then input looper rely on order for switching; if the order is changes during the course of the switching , then subsequent N+1 switch it attempt to create would rely on the order.Â </strong></li>-->
      <li>If the Video Cloud account is configured for geo-restriction, then the channel <strong>Output Region</strong> should be created in a  region compatible with the Video Cloud geo-restriction policy.</li>
      <li>For the best experience, Brightcove recommends using the Google Chrome browser.</li>
      <li>
        For SSAI-enabled channels, the destination must be set to an ad-enabled RTP live event:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/s-cloudplayout-img/advanced-options-for-live-job.png" alt="Live Settings for SSAI Channel">
          <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Live Settings for SSAI Channel</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Currently, channels enabled for SSAI cannot include live events.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Known_issues">Known issues</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Currently the <strong>Channels</strong> and <strong>Overlays</strong> links on the left take you to the Dashboard instead of the correct locations:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/s-cloudplayout-img/known-issues-links.png" alt="Broken Links">
          <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Broken Links</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p><strong>Workarounds</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>To get to the Channels list, click Cloud Playout icon in the global navigation on the left instead. (Follow the green arrow in the screenshot above.)</li>
          <li>To add new overlays, go to a draft or running channel and add an overlay to it (static or dynamic). In the selector to choose the overlay, select Add New (Image or Overlay), and enter the URL for it:
            <div style="position: relative; display: block; max-width: 640px;"><div style="padding-top: 47.81%;"><iframe src="https://players.brightcove.net/6225316964001/Qznf2bKtV_default/index.html?videoId=6267507442001" allowfullscreen="" allow="encrypted-media" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div></div>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Some buttons are partly cut off in the upper-right corner of channel details screens are partly cut off. The images below show you equivalent screenshots from {{ site.product_short }} and Video Cloud:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: .5rem;">
              <figure class="bcls-figure">
                <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/s-cloudplayout-img/known-issues-right-side-cut-off.png" alt="In {{ site.product_short }}">
                <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">In {{ site.product_short }}</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </td>
            <td style="padding: .5rem;">
              <figure class="bcls-figure">
                <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/s-cloudplayout-img/known-issues-buttons-not-cut-off-videocloud.png" alt="In Video Cloud">
                <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">In Video Cloud</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p><strong>Workaround</strong></p>
        <p>Enough of the buttons is still visible that you should able to tell what they are.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
