    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Many channel providers need to add new content to the channel on a regular basis. The <strong>Add Program</strong> and <strong>Link Program</strong> features of Cloud Playout allow you to easily add a whole program (playlist) of new content, or relink an existing program (playlist) to the channel to update the program items or simply play it again.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note that changes made to a program will be applied to all instances of the program that are linked to the channel.</aside>
    <p>This feature is available to all accounts that have Cloud Playout. It works on non-looped channels only.</p>

    <h2 id="Features">Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple programs can be created and associated with a Cloud Playout channel.</li>
      <li>A channel can have 30 active programs at any point in time,  but once a program has completed, it is automatically archived and make space for an additional program, so there is no true limit to the number of programs linked to a channel.</li>
      <li><a href="{{ site.cloud_playout_path }}cloud-playout/managing-slates.html">Slate</a> content will be looped during any gaps in the schedule. A default slate is provided, but you can add a custom slate <strong>only while the channel is in a DRAFT state.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="{{ site.cloud_playout_path }}">Hard start</a> can be used at the program level or channel level (first program in the list) but these may conflict, and they use different instances of the slate. We recommend using one or the other, but not both. If both are set for a channel, the program-level hard start is given the highest priority and the channel will start playback on the program hard start time.</li>
      <li>The <strong>Play Now</strong> option can be used on any video in the channel, but we recommend that you use it only on videos within the current program.</li>
      <li>When the channel is playing, if you need to add or update a <a href=""></a></li>

    <h2 id="Limitations">Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple programs are allowed only for channels where looping is disabled. Looping channels are allowed to have only a single program/playlist.</li>
      <li>The start time and end time for a program are shown only for the first 5 programs in the list. As the channel starts running and programs get completed, the next set of 5 programs is populated with the start time/end time.</li>
      <li>Videos should not be added or removed before the currently playing video - this impacts the playback order and may disrupt playback.</li>
    </ul>
